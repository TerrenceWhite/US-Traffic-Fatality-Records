# US-Traffic-Fatality-Records
This project uses Pandas to explore the US traffic fatality data made available by the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which was created in the United States by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The project was completed in the associated Jupyter notebook: accidents.ipynb

The file can be previewed in github, but for best results, it needs to be run inside of an IPython session.
