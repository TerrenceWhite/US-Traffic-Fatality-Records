# US-Traffic-Fatality-Records
This project explores the US traffic fatality data made available by the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which was created in the United States by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The data was made available via a Kaggle competition and provides a broad assessment of highway safety. The data was collected and made freely available to help suggest solutions to the epidemic of highway fatalities. It also helps in the evaluation of the efficacy of motor vehicle safety standards and highway safety programs.
